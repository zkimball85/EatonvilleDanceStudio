## Overview
The Eatonville Dance Studio Management Portal is a full-stack Web application designed to eliminate the logistical chaos of running a modern dance studio. It replaces scattered spreadsheets and paper forms with a centralized platform for class registration, secure tuition billing, competition tracking, and direct communication.

Built using .NET 10 ASP.NET Core MVC, the platform serves three distinct user roles: **Parents/Dancers**, **Instructors**, and **Studio Directors**, providing each with a tailored dashboard and role-based authorization to manage their specific responsibilities.

## Key Features

### Parent & Dancer Experience
*   **Household Management:** Group multiple dancers under a single parent account with automated multi-class tuition discounting.
*   **Self-Service Dashboard:** Register for classes, track upcoming events, and view competition itineraries.
*   **Secure Billing:** View itemized ledgers for tuition, costume fees, and fundraiser credits, and pay securely via integrated payment gateways.
*   **Digital Waivers:** Review and digitally sign liability and medical releases.

### Instructor Tools
*   **Class Management:** View approved class rosters, flag medical notes, and submit daily digital attendance.
*   **Secure Communication:** Post announcements, choreography notes, and private rehearsal videos directly to class-specific message boards.
*   **Payroll Tracking:** Log and track teaching hours and private lessons for administrative review.

### Director (Admin) Control
*   **Global Oversight:** God-mode CRUD access for all users, classes, events, and financials.
*   **Competition Logistics:** Track costume sizing and ordering, build performance itineraries, and establish backstage call times.
*   **Automated Comms:** Broadcast urgent SMS/Email alerts (e.g., weather closures) and automated payment reminders.
*   **Financial Reporting:** Track studio-wide revenue, apply custom invoice charges, and manage fundraiser credits.

## Tech Stack
*   **Framework:** .NET 10 (ASP.NET Core MVC)
*   **Language:** C# 14, Razor (HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript)
*   **Data Access:** Entity Framework Core 10 (Code First / DbContext)
*   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
*   **Authentication & Auth:** ASP.NET Core Identity (Role-Based Access Control)
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Stripe.net SDK (Payments), Twilio / SendGrid SDKs (SMS & Email Alerts)
